# About Ayla

The purpose of this repository is to explain where the idea came from, talk about the future of this project, and tell some trivia about it.

## ðŸ˜Ž The Name:

First of all I would like to say that the name Ayla itself has no official meaning. 

## ðŸ’¡ Where the Ideia come from?
The idea was born in 2020, when the professor asked us if we had any for our final work. But we had a problem, we only had a few weeks of face-to-face classes and we saw that besides the difficulty of getting used to distance classes, contact between people, especially in the hospital environment, should be avoided at all, having it only when necessary. 

This is where we had an idea, we saw the importance and the lack that a quick diagnosis makes in moments of crisis. Ayla was born with a mission to help people in the most crucial process of getting to the hospital, especially in moments when contact and speed are vital, since every second counts.

At the moment Ayla uses simple codes to do the triage process and you can learn more about it in the [AylaDocs repo](https://github.com/ayla-tcc/AylaDocs). 

Some of the code used to accomplish the movement, and use of the Arduino sensors was created by other people and you would like to thank them by referencing them below by the following people below:

## ðŸ”® The future of this project
This part will be updated as soon as we have a group consensus. \

But I can tell you that it will contain more information about the license and whether we will continue to support the project or leave it to the community
